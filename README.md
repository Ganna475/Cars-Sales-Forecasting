Car Sales Forecasting



1- Overview

- This project aims to forecast car sales using data-driven methods and predictive modeling. The notebook SalesForecasting(cars).ipynb walks through the process of data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and forecasting future sales trends.

2- Objectives

- Analyze historical car sales data.

- Identify key factors influencing sales performance.

- Build and evaluate predictive models to forecast future car sales.

- Visualize sales trends for actionable insights.

4- Workflow Summary

- Data Loading — Importing and inspecting car sales dataset.

- Data Preprocessing — Handling missing values, encoding, and feature scaling.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — Understanding sales patterns, trends, and correlations.

- Modeling — Training forecasting models such as:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Time-series models (ARIMA / Prophet / LSTM, depending on data type)

- Evaluation — Using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R² to assess model accuracy.

- Forecasting — Predicting future car sales and visualizing trends.



5- Results

- Forecasted sales performance for upcoming months/years.

- Visual insights into trends, seasonality, and model predictions.

- Comparative analysis of different forecasting methods.



6- Future Improvements

- Incorporate external factors (economic indicators, marketing data, etc.).

- Experiment with deep learning (LSTM/GRU) for sequential prediction.

- Deploy as a web dashboard for real-time forecasting.
